## Creative Portion (15 Points)
### If there are more than 2 events in a day, make a button to new a dialog
+ Add 3 or more events and you will see a 'More Events' link to see the full list of events for the day.
+ Useful for maintaining the layout of the calendar as space for the day is limited.

### Users can share their calendar with other users
+ Users can add others to share the event with in the 'Sharing with' section at the top left.
+ Click add button to share.
+ Once you add a user, switch to the user you just added. You can see shared events.
+ You can test with bob and emma account.

### There is a my page that lists whole user events and shared events.
+ If you click my page link at the top-right, you can see whole schedules.
+ It's useful when checking all the events.
+ Shared events of other users are listed as well.
